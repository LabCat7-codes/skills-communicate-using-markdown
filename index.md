# Had to edit this file from the created pull request
> But edit was greyed out in the three dot menu at the top-right side of the index.md
## followed the following steps instead:
1. went to repository homepage, then branches, then selected the start-markdown branch
2. clicked on index.md there
3. pressed the edit pencil
4. then typed here

That's it I guess. Also I see if you made a numbered list, the numbers don't update if you delete the first list item.

Next up: press Preview and type a meaningful commit message.
